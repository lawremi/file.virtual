Provides a Virtual File System API for R. An abstract FileSystem maps
a URI to a File object. By default, this is based on the URI
scheme. Each File type may be implemented to support all existing file
manipulation functions in R. A file parsing framework, based on the
File abstraction, supports automatic format recognition, and can
access data from any File, whether local, remote or virtual.
