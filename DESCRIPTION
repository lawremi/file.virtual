Title: VFS API for R
Version: 0.1
Author: Michael Lawrence
Maintainer: Michael Lawrence <michafla@gene.com>
Description: Provides a Virtual File System API for R. An abstract
             FileSystem maps a URI to a File object. By default, this
             is based on the URI scheme. Each File type may be
             implemented to support all existing file manipulation
             functions in R. A file parsing framework, based on the
             File abstraction, supports automatic format recognition,
             and can access data from any File, whether local, remote
             or virtual.
